# Input Data Directory

Place your input data files in this directory:

- `seqs.fa` - FASTA file containing DNA sequences
- `columns/` - Directory containing column data files (*.txt format)

These files are ignored by git for privacy/size reasons. Make sure to add your own data files before running the analysis.
